# üßë‚Äçü¶≤ Baldness Prediction Model

## üìå Problem Statement

Hair loss is a common concern for many individuals, and understanding the likelihood or extent of baldness can be valuable for early prevention or treatment. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the **degree of hair loss** a person might experience based on various features.

Despite our initial efforts, the current model shows an **error rate of around 46%**, indicating that there is significant room for improvement. This suggests that either a better dataset is required or further tuning of the model and feature engineering is needed.

## üìÇ What This Notebook Does

The `BaldnessModel.ipynb` notebook walks through the process of:

1. **Importing and exploring the dataset**  
   We load and examine the data to understand the key features that might influence hair loss.

2. **Preprocessing the data**  
   This includes handling missing values, normalizing/standardizing data, and preparing it for training.

3. **Training a machine learning model**  
   We apply a supervised learning model (e.g., regression or classification) to predict the level of baldness.

4. **Evaluating model performance**  
   Metrics such as error rate and accuracy are used to determine how reliable the model is.

5. **Predicting for a sample individual**  
   A sample prediction is made for a hypothetical person, and results are discussed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

- The current model has limited accuracy (~54%), making it unreliable for real-world use.
- Further work is needed on:
  - Expanding or improving the dataset.
  - Trying alternative machine learning algorithms.
  - Feature selection and engineering.
  - Hyperparameter tuning.
